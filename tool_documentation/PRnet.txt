**Important**: 
1: It is compulsory to change the virtual environment with name of "PRnet" before running anything below.
2: It is compulsory to change the current working directory to PRnet folder (PRnet/) before running anything below. 

Step 1: Inference with custom datatset
Please see custom_data_preprocessing.ipynb to prepare your dataset. 'custom_data_preprocessing' is a demo which preprocesses the data from CCLE.

Step 2: Train and test with provided datatset
To train the L1000 dataset:
python train_lincs.py --split_key drug_split_4    

To test the L1000 dataset:
python test_lincs.py --split_key drug_split_4     

To train the Sci-plex dataset:
python train_sciplex.py --split_key drug_split_0   

To test the Sci-plex dataset:
python test_sciplex.py --split_key drug_split_0    

Step 3: Analysis the results
To analysis the L1000 dataset:
python analysis_lincs.py --split_key drug_split_4    

To analysis the Sci-plex dataset:
python analysis_sciplex.py --split_key drug_split_0
